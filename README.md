# FreeBSD dependency solver for Linux compatible layer  

* * * 

This is a just enough script wrote for solving dependencies required y FreeBSD's Linux binary compatible layer.  

It gives an interactive enviroment, but just enough.  And it is wrote with bash at first. I have re-wrote it with C SHELL syntax without enough testing.
